    * Keep track of all the IP addresses a Player connects from, for easier & more complete bans.
    * Immediately identify alts of banned players (Supports UltraBans, FigAdmin, BanHammer, Essentials, & CommandBook)..
    * Receive on-Join notifications about how many alts a player has been associated with.
	* Easy-to-install Web-Interface! (Web-Tracker: https://github.com/NINJ4/Web-Tracker )
	* Automatically trim database sizes to recent players!
    * Easy setup: drag, drop, and go, or fine tune your configuration.NO configuration necessary!
    * Wildcard search matching, even with offline players! 
    * Don't want Minebans/glizer/MCBans/MCBouncer managing your bans? This plugin can allow you to look up any player on these two systems without relying on their plugins!
    * Hide certain players from lookups (Admins, VIPs, whatever) to avoid having their alts discovered!
